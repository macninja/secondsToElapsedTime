# secondsToElapsedTime
During another project I needed a way to convert seconds to how much time had passed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, follow along to see how to convert 8,274 seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.

First, find the number of whole hours

8,274 seconds = 8,274 seconds ÷ 3,600
8,274 seconds = 2.29833 hours
full hours = 2

Find the number of whole minutes

minutes = .29833 hours × 60 minutes
minutes = 17.9 minutes
full minutes = 17

Find the remaining seconds

seconds = .9 minutes × 60 seconds
seconds = 54 seconds

Finish up by rewriting as HH:MM:SS

time = 2:17:54

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Script output

$ time spendt 2:17:54
